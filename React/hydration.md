## Hydration

Is the process of basically making our application interactive. So we can say that is the process of loading our javascript (or attaching our scripts) into our raw HTML.

One interestting example we can use is say that our website is **loading** while the hydration is happenning. 
Because you will probably be seeing components in a load state (Example: buttons that are gray because they can't be interactive with). 

Those components are our HTML, what we are waiting for is the JS to make the website interactive in some form.
