# Mostly useless guide

## What the heck is this?

A repository with notes about multiple different subjects that I study related to tech, what is useful or just trivia is up to you, it's interesting information nonetheless.

- Fun info: The name of this repo is inspired by the book [Mostly adequate guide](https://github.com/MostlyAdequate/mostly-adequate-guide).

I don't know about you, but a lot of times I find some interesting topic about something that makes me wanna write about it. It's like "I don't want to loose that information, so I'm gonna write down!". Well, that's the purpose of this repository, consider it my **open-source notebook**.

### Table of contents

- [Functional Programming (FP)]()
- [Web Development]()
  - [React]()

#### Future Ideas
