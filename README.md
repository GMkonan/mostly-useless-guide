A repository with notes about multiple different subjects that are related to typescript in some way.
( Or at least in some way that I use typescript :) )

I don't know about you, but a lot of times I find some interestting topic about something that makes me wanna write about it. It's like "I don't want to loose that information, so I'm gonna write down!". Well, that's the purpose of this repository, consider it my **open-source notebook**.
