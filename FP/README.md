This section of the repo contain notes about important Functional programming concepts using Typescript/Javascript aswell as useful links about it. They are all notes I took while studying those topics myself.

- First Class Functions

### Useful Links

Probably every concept will have a `useful links` section with links about that section alone,
here the links are general (links that cover more than one thing about FP for example).
