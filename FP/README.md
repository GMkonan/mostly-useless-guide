This section of the repo contain notes about important Functional programming concepts using Typescript/Javascript aswell as useful links about it. They are all notes I took while studying those topics myself.

- First Class Functions
- Pure functions and side Effects
- curry

A lot of those notes are based on Professors Frisby's book (like some examples and the order things are presented).
Take a look at his book for a more in depth approach in Functional Programming! Link below.

### Useful Links

Probably every concept will have a `useful links` section with links about that section alone,
here the links are general (links that cover more than one thing about FP for example).
